// 1. Equipment Rental Availability (Graph Algorithm â€“ BFS/DFS)
// Problem Statement:
// Equip9 manages a network of equipment rental providers. Each provider has connections with other providers, allowing customers to rent equipment even if their preferred provider does not have availability. Given a list of providers and their connections, determine the shortest path to find the nearest available equipment of a given type.
// Input:
// n (number of rental providers)
// edges (list of connections between providers as [providerA, providerB])
// availability (a dictionary {provider: [equipment_type1, equipment_type2, ...]})
// start_provider (the provider where the customer is searching)
// target_equipment (equipment type the customer needs)
// Output:
// Return the shortest path (minimum number of provider connections) to a provider that has the requested equipment. If no provider has it, return -1.
// Example Input:
var n = 5;
var edges = [
  [1, 2],
  [2, 3],
  [3, 4],
  [4, 5],
];
var availability = {
  1: ["excavator"],
  2: [],
  3: ["bulldozer"],
  4: ["excavator"],
  5: ["crane"],
};

var start_provider = 2;
var target_equipment = "excavator";

// Example Output:
// [2, 3, 4]  # Shortest path to provider 4 with an excavator

/*
NOTE:
Provider 1 has an excavator and is directly connected to provider 2.
Since we are looking for the shortest path the algo correctly returns [2, 1] instead of [2, 3, 4].

Even though provider 4 also has an excavator, reaching it takes more hops.
So, [2, 1] is the correct result in this case.
